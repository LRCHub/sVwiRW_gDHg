[00:01.08] Ah, yes (uh-uh)
[00:02.32] Uh, check it out, uh
[00:12.32] 
[00:05.46] Well, looky here, looky here, ah, what do we have?
[00:08.65] Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
[00:11.56] But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
[00:14.12] 'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding
[00:42.62] 
[00:17.05] "I love you so" (Hey), that's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
[00:20.04] You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
[00:22.92] But when I play (but when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
[00:25.84] So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say
[00:51.34] 
[00:29.20] Run, run, run away, run away, baby
[00:32.00] Before I put my spell on you
[00:34.61] You better get, get, get away, get away, darling
[00:37.93] 'Cause everything you heard is true
[00:40.13] Your poor little heart will end up alone
[00:43.29] 'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
[00:46.18] So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
[01:10.18]

[00:53.65] Ah, yeah
[00:57.65] 
[00:54.90] Well, let me think, let me think, ah, what should I do?
[00:58.03] So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
[01:01.34] Now even though they're eating out the palm of my hand
[01:04.27] There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it
[01:29.77] 
[01:06.79] "I love you so" (Hey), that's what you'll say (that's what you'll say)
[01:09.78] You'll tell me, "Baby, baby, please don't go away" (Don't go away)
[01:12.50] But when I play (but when I play), I never stay (I never stay)
[01:15.49] So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say
[01:40.99] 
[01:19.06] Run, run, run away, run away, baby
[01:21.84] Before I put my spell on you
[01:24.49] You better get, get, get away, get away, darling
[01:27.69] 'Cause everything you heard is true
[01:29.93] Your poor little heart will end up alone
[01:33.00] 'Cause Lord knows I'm a rolling stone
[01:35.86] So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby
[01:59.86] 
[01:40.89] Uh, check it out
[01:44.47] See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby, no, no
[01:47.39] No, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
[01:50.34] See, I ain't tryna hurt you, baby, no, no
[01:53.30] No, I just wanna work you, baby
[01:55.42] If you scared, you better run (you better run)
[01:58.10] You better run (you better run)
[01:59.51] You better run (you better run)
[02:00.92] You better, you better, you better
[02:17.92] 
[02:03.00] Run, run, run away, run away, baby
[02:05.73] Before I put my spell on you
[02:08.35] You better get, get, get away, get away, darling
